        "You work for a project management company, and they want to offer a simple time tracker tool for their clients. The tool will let users log the number of hours spent on different tasks and then provide a summary at the end.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Instructions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Create a list called `tasks` and populate it with initial tasks: \"Planning\", \"Design\", \"Coding\", \"Testing\".\n",
        "2. Create another list called `time_spent` to store the time spent on each task. Initialize it with zeros.\n",
        "3. Create a function called `log_time` that takes a task name and an amount of time. It will find the task in the `tasks` list and update the corresponding time in `time_spent`.\n",
        "4. Use a `while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for a task and time spent on that task until they choose to exit.\n",
        "5. Use a `for` loop to go through the `tasks` and `time_spent` lists, printing out a summary of time spent on each task.\n"
